# Comments starting with a hash symbol
# Possible forms of each line:
#  1) CASE name num-pe num-pe-subs num-comp impl-per-comp mode-per-impl
#  2) REWRITE n (comp-name prop-name new-value){n}
# A case may be followed by arbirtrary many rewrites. After each rewrite the ilp is
#  generated, the time for generation is measured and written to the result file.
#  A rewrite affects $n properties.
# Note: Component names are of the form "comp"("_"NUMBER)+ where each number block denotes
#  the depth in the resource tree, and the number itself is the child index.
# Note: Hardware property names are "load" and "frequency".
